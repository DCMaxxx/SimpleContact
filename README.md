What is it ?
-------

Aren't you tired of using dozens of applications to contact your friends ?
+ Phone.app,
+ Messages.app,
+ Mail.app,
+ FaceTime.app...

Well, I am. So I decided to write my own application.  
It's design to call, mail, send a message or a iMessage easily and quickly.

What ? It's not fast enough ? Alright, I'll add favorites, so you can contact your friends in one click !   
But remember, I'm still working on it when I have free time, so stay tuned.

How can I get it ?
-------
For now, you'll have to :
+ Own a Mac
+ An iDevice on iOS 6.0+ (UICollectionView)
+ A developper licence (and if you don't, you can try it in the simulator !)
+ XCode 5 DP5+ (else you can't open the storyboard)

In a few weeks, I plan to post it on the store, under the same name, SimpleContact.


Can I see it ?
-------
Well, it's not finished...  
Alright, alright. Here are some screenshot, but remeber, it might evolve with time !

Here is the default view of the application :

You can swipe on a contact to reveal buttons to call him, send him a mail... :

And of course, you can select which number you want to call :

If you have added a number into favorites, just go to the favorite's view to call / text / FaceTime / Mail it.

I'll update picture with new features.


Can I give my opinion ?
-------
Of course ! I'd love to here from you.
